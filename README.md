# Weather-station

## What is it?

I was given the challenge of creating a weather application.

## What are the features?
* The user can search for any city and find information about the weather there.
* Any city the user search is added to local storage and saved.
* When the user searches a city they are presented with the current weather data, as well as a five-day forecast
